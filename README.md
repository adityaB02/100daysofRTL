# 100_days_of_RTL
100 Days Of RTL is a personal challenge designed to help improve skills and knowledge in digital circuit design. The challenge involves committing to working on RTL based digital designs for 100 consecutive days. The goal is to build a solid foundation of knowledge and experience in the field.
RTL (Register Transfer Level) design/digital logic design in system verilog(.sv) and use of verification methodologies.
Practise design and verification of various logic circuits with the goal of RISC-V (RV32I, RV32MAC) multi-stage pipeline processor, FIFOs(synchrounous and asynchrounous), different protocols(I2C, SPI, AMBA, PCIe).

DAY001 - MUX  :   2to1MUX ,     4to1MUX using structural-modelling

DAY002  - ADDERS  :   Half_Adder,   Full_Adder,   Ripple-carry_Adder,   Carry-look-ahead_Adder
